# The Female Body in Aerospace Medicine

### 🧭 Overview
This presentation explores the challenges women face in aerospace and aviation medicine, focusing on how biological, physiological, and systemic factors affect their experiences as pilots, astronauts, and aerospace professionals.

### 🛰️ Key Topics
- **Design Bias:** How aircraft, space equipment, and flight uniforms are primarily designed around male physiology.  
- **Medical Challenges:** The unique physiological effects of space travel and high-altitude flight on the female body.  
- **Qualification Barriers:** The requirements to qualify as a pilot in the military and how they intersect with gendered standards.  
- **Representation & Inclusion:** The historical and ongoing efforts to make aerospace medicine more inclusive and equitable.  

### 🧬 Biological and Environmental Factors
We also examine the biological effects of space on the female body — from bone density and hormonal cycles to cardiovascular changes and radiation exposure — and how these differ from male counterparts.

### 👩‍🚀 Goal
To highlight the need for inclusive research and design in aerospace medicine, ensuring safety, performance, and opportunity for everyone, regardless of gender.
